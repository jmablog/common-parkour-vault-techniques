This study aimed at comparing the neuromuscular profile of a non-trained group (NT, n = 10) to power athletes practising Parkour (= traceurs, group PK, n = 11), an activity consisting of jumping obstacles mostly in an urban landscape.METHODS: Maximal isometric plantar flexion force (MVC) and rate of torque development (RTD) were evaluated, and neuromuscular function of triceps surae muscles was assessed and compared between groups through the analysis of evoked potentials from posterior tibial nerve stimulation.RESULTS: PK group exhibited higher MVC force (131.3 ± 8.7 Nm) than NT (110.4 ± 9.6 Nm, P = 0.03) and higher RTD (489.1 ± 93 Nm/s) than NT (296.9 ± 81 Nm/s). At a nervous level, this greater performance was related to a greater voluntary activation level (PK: 96.8 ± 3.6%; NT: 91.5 ± 7.7%; P = 0.02) and soleus V-wave amplitude (P = 0.03), and a lower antagonist co-activation (P = 0.02) and rest soleus spinal excitability (PK Hmax/Mmax: 0.32 ± 0.13; NT: 0.58 ± 0.17; P < 0.001). At a muscular level, PK group exhibited higher mechanical twitch amplitude (PK: 13.42 ± 3.52 Nm; NT: 9.86 ± 4.38 Nm; P = 0.03) and electromechanical efficiency (P = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: The greater maximal force production capacity of traceurs compared to untrained was underlain by nervous factors, such as greater descending command and greater ability to modulate the spinal excitability, but also by muscular factors such as greater excitation-contraction coupling efficiency. The high eccentric loads that characterize Parkour training may have led traceurs to exhibit such neuromuscular profile.}, doi = {10.1007/s00421-018-3868-1}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{Croft2017,author = {Croft, JL and Bertram, JEA}, title = {Affordance Boundaries Are Defined by Dynamic Capabilities of Parkour Athletes in Dropping from Various Heights}, journal = {Frontiers in Psychology}, volume = {8}, number = {}, pages = {1571}, year = {2017}, abstract = {Available behaviors are determined by the fit between features of the individual and reciprocal features of the environment. Beyond some critical boundary certain behaviors become impossible causing sudden transitions from one movement pattern to another. Parkour athletes have developed multiple movement patterns to deal with their momentum during landing. We were interested in whether drop distance would cause a sudden transition between a two-footed (precision) landing and a load-distributing roll and whether the transition height could be predicted by dynamic and geometric characteristics of individual subjects. Kinematics and ground reaction forces were measured as Parkour athletes stepped off a box from heights that were incrementally increased or decreased from 0.6 to 2.3 m. Individuals were more likely to roll from higher drops; those with greater body mass and less explosive leg power, were more likely to transition to a roll landing at a lower height. At some height a two-footed landing is no longer feasible but for some athletes this height was well within the maximum drop height used in this study. During low drops the primary task constraint of managing momentum could be achieved with either a precision landing or a roll. This meant that participants were free to select their preferred landing strategy, which was only partially influenced by the physical demands of the task.

The aims of this study were (i) to investigate age, anthropometric and training characteristics of Parkour practitioners, called ‘traceurs’ and (ii) to assess jump performances and muscular characteristics of traceurs, compared to those of gymnasts and power athletes. The mean age of the population of traceurs studied (n = 130) was 19.4 ± 4.3 years, women represented 12.4% of the total field and mean training volume was 8.1 ± 0.5 hours/week. Vertical and long jump performances were analysed on smaller samples of participants (four groups, n = 15 per group); and eccentric (-90° s(-1), -30° s(-1)), concentric (30° s(-1), 90° s(-1)) and isometric knee extensors torques were evaluated by means of an isokinetic dynamometer. Traceurs showed greater (P < .01) drop jump performance (64.9 ± 1.5 cm) than gymnasts (60.9 ± 1.1 cm) and greater (P < .001) counter movement jump with arms (59.2 ± 1.5 cm) than power athletes (53.0 ± 1.4 cm).

Eccentric knee extension torques were greater (P < .05) for traceurs compared to other athletes. This study revealed that Parkour training induces major development of jump and muscular skills.

There have been only few publications on injuries in this young and trendy sport mainly performed in urban areas. The aim of this study is to analyse parkour-related acute injuries and their factors. METHODS: For the retrospective cross-sectional study, a total of n = 266 traceurs (m: n = 255, w: n = 11) completed anonymized online questionnaires. RESULTS: On average, each traceur sustained 1.9 injuries per sport career/year, or 5.5 injuries/1000 h training, respectively. The upper extremity was the most affected body region (58 %), followed by the lower extremity (27 %), head and the back. An increase of injuries from proximal to distal was observed in the upper extremity. However, for the lower extremity it was the opposite. Of all injuries, the most common were skin abrasions (70.3 %). Muscle injuries were observed in 13.1 % of the traceurs, followed by dislocations (6.1 %), and soft tissue (e. g., ligaments, tendons) injuries (5.3 %). Passive precautionary measures were abandoned by the majority of the traceurs (88 %). Landing belonged to the movement elements resulting in most of the injuries (61 %), followed by supportive and static efforts of the arms (10.7 %). Overestimation (23 %) as well as misjudging the situation (20 %) were the most common causes. CONCLUSION: Other than expected, parkour is an urban movement style with most of the injuries being neither severe nor common despite the lack of precautionary measures. Localisation and type of injuries reflect the characteristic movement elements.

Subjects completed 10 landing trials onto a force platform at each height. SUBJECTS: Ten female competitive gymnasts (height = 1.57 +/- 0.02 m, mass = 55.4 +/- 7.3 kg) and 10 female recreational athletes (height = 1.63 +/- 0.06 m, mass = 59.6 +/- 4.9 kg) volunteered for this study. MEASUREMENTS: Measurements of first peak-force magnitude (F1), time to F1 (T1), impulse to F1, second peak-force magnitude (F2), time to F2 (T2), and impulse to F2 were compiled to describe the ground reaction force profile for each trial at 30-, 60-, and 90-cm platform heights. A 2 x 3 (group x height) mixed-factors analysis of variance was calculated for each of the 6 variables. RESULTS: The group-by-height interaction was significant for F1, F2, and impulse to F2. Tukey post hoc analyses revealed significantly higher values for the gymnasts than for the recreational athletes at 60- and 90-cm heights for F1 and F2 magnitudes. Differences between groups for T1, T2, impulse to F1, and impulse to F2 were not statistically significant at any height.

They were evaluated by a physician and underwent anthropometric assessment, strength testing and three-dimensional landing biomechanical analyses prior to their basketball season. 145 of these athletes met inclusion for surveillance of incident (new) PFP by certified athletic trainers during their competitive season. The ‘ACL cohort’ included 205 high school female volleyball, soccer and basketball athletes who underwent the same anthropometric, strength and biomechanical assessment prior to their competitive season and were subsequently followed up for incidence of ACL injury. A one-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate potential group (incident PFP vs ACL injured) differences in anthropometrics, strength and landing biomechanics. Knee abduction moment (KAM) cut-scores that provided the maximal sensitivity and specificity for prediction of PFP or ACL injury risk were also compared between the cohorts. RESULTS: KAM during landing above 15.4 Nm was associated with a 6.8% risk to develop PFP compared to a 2.9% risk if below the PFP risk threshold in our sample. Likewise, a KAM above 25.3 Nm was associated with a 6.8% risk for subsequent ACL injury compared to a 0.4% risk if below the established ACL risk threshold. The ACL-injured athletes initiated landing with a greater knee abduction angle and a reduced hamstrings-to-quadriceps strength ratio relative to the incident PFP group. Also, when comparing across cohorts, the athletes who suffered ACL injury also had lower hamstring/quadriceps ratio than the players in the PFP sample (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In adolescent girls aged 13.3 years, >15 Nm of knee abduction load during landing is associated with greater likelihood of developing PFP. Also, in girls aged 16.1 years who land with >25 Nm of knee abduction load during landing are at increased risk for both PFP and ACL injury.}, doi = {10.1136/bjsports-2013-092536}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{Ingram2008,author = {Ingram, JG and Fields, SK and Yard, EE and Comstock, RD}, title = {Epidemiology of knee injuries among boys and girls in US high school athletics}, journal = {American Journal of Sports Medicine}, volume = {36}, number = {6}, pages = {1116–1122}, year = {2008}, abstract = {BACKGROUND: The knee joint is the second most commonly injured body site and the leading cause of high school sports-related surgeries. Knee injuries are among the most economically costly sports injuries and may require subsequent surgery or extensive and expensive rehabilitation. PURPOSE: To report the incidence, risk, and severity of high school knee injuries across sports, genders, and type of exposure. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: During the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 school years, 100 US high schools were randomly selected for a nationally representative sample. Certified athletic trainers tracked injuries using an online injury surveillance system, High School RIO, in 9 high school sports. RESULTS: There were 1383 knee injuries reported during 3,551131 athlete exposures for a rate of 3.89 knee injuries per 10,000 athlete exposures. Although boys had a higher overall rate of knee injury (rate ratio, 1.38; confidence interval, 1.22-1.55), girls were twice as likely to sustain knee injuries requiring surgery (major knee injuries) than were boys (injury proportion ratio, 1.98; confidence interval, 1.45-2.70) and twice as likely to incur noncontact major knee injuries (injury proportion ratio, 1.98; confidence interval, 1.23-3.19) as were boys. Although illegal play was identified as a contributing factor in only 5.7% of all knee injuries, 20% of knee injuries resulting from illegal play required surgery. CONCLUSION: Knee injury rates and patterns varied by sport, gender, and type of exposure. Identified gender differences included differences in injury rates, injury severity, and basic injury mechanism. Further surveillance is crucial for the development of targeted, evidence-based injury prevention strategies to reduce the morbidity and economic impact of knee surgeries.}, doi = {10.1177/0363546508314400}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{Witvrouw2000,author = {Witvrouw, Erik and Lysens, Roeland and Bellemans, Johan and Cambier, Dirk and Vanderstraeten, Guy}, title = {Intrinsic risk factors for the development of anterior knee pain in an athletic population: a two-year prospective study}, journal = {American Journal of Sports Medicine}, volume = {28}, number = {4}, pages = {480–489}, year = {2000}, abstract = {Many variables have retrospectively been associated with the presence of anterior knee pain.

PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of jumper’s knee in nonelite athletes from different sports and to determine potential risk factors for jumper’s knee. DESIGN: Cohort study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: The authors interviewed 891 male and female nonelite athletes from 7 popular sports in The Netherlands: basketball, volleyball, handball, korfball, soccer, field hockey, and track and field. Using a specially developed questionnaire, information was obtained about individual characteristics (age, height, and weight), training background, previous and actual knee problems, and the VISA-P (Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Patella) score. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of current jumper’s knee was 8.5% (78 of 891 athletes), showing a significant difference between sports with different loading characteristics. Prevalence was highest among volleyball players (14.4%) and lowest among soccer players (2.5%); it was significantly higher among male athletes (51 of 502 [10.2%]) than female athletes (25 of 389 [6.4%]) (χ(2) = 3.91, P =.048). The mean duration of symptoms was 18.9 months (standard deviation [SD], 21.6; median value, 12.0; range, 2.0-59.8). The mean VISA-P score of the athletes with jumper’s knee was 71.4 (SD, 13.8). Athletes with jumper’s knee were significantly younger, taller, and heavier than those without jumper’s knee. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of jumper’s knee is high among nonelite athletes and varies between 14.4% and 2.5% for different sports.

Most studies assessed the kinetics of plyometric exercises primarily performed in the vertical plane. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the multiplanar kinetic characteristics of a variety of plyometric exercises, which have a significant horizontal component. This study also sought to assess sex differences in the intensity progression of these exercises. Ten men and 10 women served as subjects. The subjects performed a variety of plyometric exercises including the double-leg hop, standing long jump, single-leg standing long jump, bounding, skipping, power skipping, cone hops, and 45.72-cm hurdle hops. Subjects also performed the countermovement jump for comparison. All plyometric exercises were evaluated using a force platform. Dependent variables included the landing rate of force development and landing ground reaction forces for each exercise in the vertical, frontal, and sagittal planes. A 2-way mixed analysis of variance with repeated-measures for plyometric exercise type demonstrated main effects for exercise type for all dependent variables (p ≤ 0.001). There was no significant interaction between plyometric exercise type and sex for any of the variable assessed. Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons identified a number of differences between the plyometric exercises for the dependent variables assessed (p ≤ 0.05). These findings should be used to guide practitioners in the progression of plyometric exercise intensity, and thus program design, for those who require significant horizontal power in their sport.}, doi = {10.1519/JSC.0000000000002096}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Incollection{McNittGray2008,author = {McNitt-Gray, JL}, title = {Musculoskeletal loading during landing}, booktitle = {Biomechanics in Sport}, editor = {Zatsiorsky, VM}, edition = {}, publisher = {Blackwell Science Ltd}, address = {Oxford, UK}, pages = {523-549}, year = {2008}, abstract = {This chapter is comprised of four sections.

METHODS: Female runners with a rearfoot strike pattern, aged between 18 and 45 yr and running at least 32 km.wk(-1), were recruited for this study. Participants in the study were 20 subjects with a history of TSF and 20 age- and mileage-matched control subjects with no previous lower extremity bony injuries. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected during overground running at 3.7 m.s(-1) using a six-camera motion capture system, force platform, and accelerometer. Variables of interest were vertical impact peak, instantaneous and average vertical loading rates, instantaneous and average loading rates during braking, knee flexion excursion, ankle and knee stiffness, and peak tibial shock. Tibial varum was measured in standing. Tibial area moment of inertia was calculated from tibial x-ray studies for a subset of runners. RESULTS: The TSF group had significantly greater instantaneous and average vertical loading rates and tibial shock than the control group. The magnitude of tibial shock predicted group membership successfully in 70% of cases.

This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS: There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections. DISCUSSION FOR READERS: When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. CONCLUSION: This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications.

Eleven male runners performed overground running trials on an indoor running track, and three-dimensional analyses techniques were used to measure running kinematics and kinetics.

The average season and personal best 1500 m race times were 3:49.7 ± 0:05.8 and 3:46.0 ± 0:08.3 minutes, respectively. Regression analysis revealed that a smaller range of sagittal-plane hip motion during swing, less thorax flexion at toe-off and a smaller ankle plantarflexion angle at contact accounted for 95.7% (p < 0.001) of the variation in season best running performance. Less sagittal-plane hip motion during swing and a smaller ankle plantarflexion angle at contact also explained 79% of the variance in personal best time. Slower middle-distance runners make initial ground contact with a more plantarflexed ankle and greater forward lean of the trunk.

Compared with non-skaters, skaters exhibited a significantly greater normalised peak GRF (3.50 ± 0.47 × body weight for skaters vs. 3.13 ± 0.45 × body weight for non-skaters), significantly shorter time to peak GRF (81.21 ± 14.01 ms for skaters vs. 93.81 ± 16.49 ms for non-skaters), and significantly longer time to stabilisation (TTS) of the GRF (2.38 ± 0.07 s for skaters vs. 2.22 ± 0.07 s for non-skaters). Skaters also confined their centre of pressure (CoP) to a significantly smaller mediolateral (M-L) (25%) and anterior-posterior (A-P) (40%) range during the landing phase, with the position of the CoP located in the mid to forefoot region. The narrower and more forward position of the CoP in skaters may at least partially explain the greater peak GRF, shorter time to peak, and longer TTS. Training and/or equipment modification serve as potential targets to decrease peak GRF by distributing it over a longer time period.

However, this information is important for understanding lower extremity injury mechanisms. We sought to determine regression relationships of landing height with these parameters during landing so as to facilitate estimation of these parameters at large landing heights. Five healthy male subjects performed landing tasks from heights of 0.15-1.05 m onto a force-plate. Motion capture system was used to obtain knee flexion angles during landing via passive markers placed on the lower body. An iterative regression model, involving simple linear/exponential/natural logarithmic functions, was used to fit regression equations to experimental data. Peak GRF followed an exponential regression relationship (R(2)=0.90-0.99, p<0.001; power=0.987-0.998). Peak GRF slope and impulse also had an exponential relationship (R(2)=0.90-0.96, p<0.001; power=0.980-0.997 and R(2)=0.90-0.99, p<0.001; power=0.990-1.000 respectively) with landing height.

METHODS: A computerized bibliographical search was conducted to extract PvGRF data on a single foot when participants landed with both feet from various DHs. An innovative mathematical model was constructed to analyze effects of gender, landing type, shoes, ankle stabilizers, surface stiffness and sample frequency on PvGRF based on the pooled data. RESULTS: Pooled PvGRF and DH data of 26 articles showed that the square root function fits their relationship well. An experimental validation was also done on the regression equation for the medicum frequency. The PvGRF was not significantly affected by surface stiffness, but was significantly higher in men than women, the platform than suspended landing, the barefoot than shod condition, and ankle stabilizer than control condition, and higher than lower frequencies.

The purpose of this study was to test the influence of isolated valgus moment on ACL strain during single-leg landing. Physiologic levels of valgus moments from an in vivo study of single-leg landing were applied to a three-dimensional dynamic knee model, previously developed and tested for ACL strain measurement during simulated landing. The ACL strain, knee valgus angle, tibial rotation, and medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain were calculated and analyzed. The study shows that the peak ACL strain increased nonlinearly with increasing peak valgus moment. Subjects with naturally high valgus moments showed greater sensitivity for increased ACL strain with increased valgus moment, but ACL strain plateaus below reported ACL failure levels when the applied isolated valgus moment rises above the maximum values observed during normal cutting activities. In addition, the tibia was observed to rotate externally as the peak valgus moment increased due to bony and soft-tissue constraints. In conclusion, knee valgus moment increases peak ACL strain during single-leg landing. However, valgus moment alone may not be sufficient to induce an isolated ACL tear without concomitant damage to the MCL, because coupled tibial external rotation and increasing strain in the MCL prevent proportional increases in ACL strain at higher levels of valgus moment. Training that reduces the external valgus moment, however, can reduce the ACL strain and thus may help athletes reduce their overall ACL injury risk.}, doi = {10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.10.031}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{Cheung2008,author = {Cheung, Roy TH and Ng, Gabriel YF}, title = {Influence of different footwear on force of landing during running}, journal = {Physical Therapy}, volume = {88}, number = {5}, pages = {620–628}, year = {2008}, abstract = {Background and Purpose Previous studies have demonstrated an increase in foot pronation with mileage in runners.

The purpose of this article is to review the current state of knowledge related to overuse running injuries, with a particular emphasis on the effect of impact forces. Recent research has suggested that runners who exhibit relatively large and rapid impact forces while running are at an increased risk of developing an overuse injury of the lower extremity. Modifications in training programs could help an injured runner return to running with decreased rehabilitation time, but it would be preferable to be able to advise a runner regarding injury potential before undertaking a running program. One of the goals of future research should be to focus on the prevention or early intervention of running injuries. This goal could be accomplished if some easily administered tests could be found which would predict the level of risk that a runner may encounter at various levels of training intensity, duration, and frequency.
